# To-Do List and Future Improvements
While the current implementation of the project meets the requirements and provides the desired functionality, there are several areas that can be further enhanced or additional features that can be added if more time is available. Here is a to-do list outlining possible improvements and missing aspects:

1. **Implement Refresh Token:** Enhance the JWT authentication mechanism by implementing a refresh token feature. This will allow users to obtain a new access token without having to reauthenticate, improving the overall user experience and security.

2. **Role-Based Authentication and Authorization:** Extend the existing authentication mechanism to incorporate role-based access control. This will enable finer-grained control over API endpoints and actions based on user roles, such as admin, user, or superadmin.

3. **Docker Compose Configuration:** Create a Docker Compose configuration file that includes both the Spring Boot application and the MySQL database. This will simplify the deployment process by encapsulating both components into a single deployment unit.

4. **Kubernetes Deployment:** Explore deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster. This would involve creating Kubernetes deployment and service manifests to ensure high availability, scalability, and resilience of the application.

5. **Database Migration Tool:** Integrate a database migration tool like Flyway or Liquibase to automate the execution of database schema changes and updates. This will streamline the process of managing database schema evolution and ensure consistency across different environments.

6. **Preload Movie Data:** Instead of verifying movie data from an external API on each request, consider preloading the movie data from the CSV file into the local database during the application startup. This will reduce the dependency on external APIs and improve performance.

7. **Improved Documentation and Diagrams:** Enhance the project documentation by providing detailed explanations, additional diagrams, and visual aids to help users understand the architecture, data flow, and overall design of the application.

8. **Cashing**

These additional features and improvements can enhance the functionality, security, deployment, and overall user experience of the application. However, it's important to consider the scope, time constraints, and project requirements when deciding which enhancements to prioritize.
